# Pepper and Carrot Comics as PDF Files

This repository contains PDF files of the Pepper and Carrot comics. These comics are drawn by David Revoy and are lovely.

The comics are published on www.peppercarrot.com. However, if you want to read them on dead trees printed at your local copy shop a PDF version is handy.

Therefore, this repository contains PDFs of all episodes in different languages. It also contains the script that generates the PDFs.

Please open an issue or a pull request if you spot errors or have an idea for an improvement.
